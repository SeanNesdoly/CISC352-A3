This repository implements the algorithms required for solving the following two problems that are outlined in the assignment 3 documentation for CISC352:
1. The **N-Queens puzzle** is the problem of placing **n** chess queens on an **n-by-n** chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This problem is solved using an **iterative repair algorithm** where conflicts are resolved using the **minimum conflicts** heuristic.
2. The **Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm** is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the **minimax algorithm** in its search tree. This is used in the context of a machine playing implementation of **zero-sum games**; the "minimax" refers to each player **minimizing** the **maximum** payoff possible for the other.
